                Regression Analysis</h5>
            <h3>What is Regression Analysis?</h3>
            <p>In short, regression analysis is a statistical method to estimate the relationship
                between a dependent variable (commonly referred to as “y” or the left side variable)
                and one or more independent variables (commonly referred to as "x" or the
                regressors). Regression analysis provides a model that allows a user to gain
                understanding of how the typical dependent variable changes with changes in the
                independent variables, <em>holding the other independent variables constant.</em>
                Because of this functionality, regression is typically used to predict or forecast
                the value of the dependent variable, when values for the independent variables are
                known.</p>
            <p>There are different types of regression models depending on the nature of the data.
                The simplest type of regression model is a standard linear model. This method may be
                familiar to a user who have done basic line of best fit work with scatter plots, as
                seen below.</p>

            <h3>Why Poisson Analysis?</h3>
            <p>Of course, whenever you include more than one variable and change the characteristics
                of the predicted variable, the more complicated a model one has to use for accurate
                results. For example, in the previous illustration the dependent variable was
                weight—which is a continuous variable (theoretically one could weigh 110 pounds,
                110.0001 pounds, 110.0002 pounds…), but what if the dependent variable was a
                discrete counting number? For our project, our dependent variable—the number of
                references to God—is a discrete variable for it can have the value 1, 2, 3… but a
                speech cannot have 1.467 references to God. The Poisson regression model is usually
                used on data of the counting nature.</p>
            <p>One of the primary differences between a simple linear regression model, and a
                Poisson regression model is what is called the “link function.” A link function is
                what links the independent variables to the error term. In the standard linear
                regression, the link function is an identity link, meaning that the coefficients or
                the “slope terms” can be interpreted as seen above. The link function for the
                Poisson model is much more complex, with the use of logarithmic functions. The model
                will be further explained with an applied approach with the data collected.</p>
            <h3>How do you interpret the results of the Poisson regresion model?</h3>
            <p>In pure mathematical terms: a one unit change in the independent variable, e.g. the
                increase of one child, other variables held constant, results in the difference in
                the logs of the expected counts in the amount of the regression coefficient of that
                variable. In equation terms:</p>
            <h3 class="equation">β = log( μx+1) - log( μx )</h3>
            <p>Where β is the regression coefficient, μ is the expected count of the dependent
                variable, denoting a one unit increase.</p>
            <p>Using rules of logarithms, a term called the incident rate ratio (IRR), which has a
                more direct interpretation as seen in the simple regression model, can be calculated
                from the Poisson regression coefficients. More information on the Poisson regression
                model can be found <a
                    href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/output/stata_poisson_output.htm"
                    >here</a>.</p>
            <h3>Our results</h3>
            <p>Our dependent variable was the average number of references to God used by a
                President, with the President's background information as the independent
                variables.For background on the variables used in our Poisson regression, check out
                the regression <a href="codebook.txt">codebook</a>. The nature of our data required
                the frequent use of binary or dummy variables.</p>
            <p>The actual statistical mathematics required to produce the Poisson model was done in
                the STATA software which is free to all University of Pittsburgh students. Upon
                running the regression, the first ouput screen looked like the following:</p>
