        <div><h5>Unaffiliated</h5>
            <p>Only one president, George Washington, is listed as unaffiliated in our
                classification of the presidents. Given Washington’s immense popularity following
                his success as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War,
                he was elected unanimously in the Electoral College and never affiliated himself
                with any political faction. However, many historians generally regard his policies
                as falling more in line with those of the Federalist Party rather than that of the
                Democratic-Republicans. </p>
            <h5>Federalist</h5>
            <p> The very first political party to hold the office of the president was the
                Federalist Party. This party held control of the executive office from 1797 to 1801
                during the presidency of John Adams. As the name suggests, this party supported a
                federal approach to government with a strong central government capable of exerting
                authority over the individual state governments. Members of this party tended to
                hail from the northern states of New England and thus supported policies of
                industrialization and economic expansion. </p>
            <h5>Democratic-Republican</h5>
            <p>In 1801 the Democratic-Republicans came into power with the election of Thomas
                Jefferson to the White House. As the opposition party to the Federalists, this party
                tended to favor the agrarian ways of the southern states over the industrialization
                of the North. In addition to this, the party supported a policy of decentralization
                and strong state governments over that of the Federal Government. </p>
            <h5>Democratic</h5>
            <p>The oldest party in the United States, the Democratic Party can trace its roots
                through the election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 to Barack Obama today. Over the years
                the party has changed to address the particular issues of the day and in many ways
                is completely opposite from its original positions. Initially, the Democratic Party
                was centered in the southern United States. As a successor the
                Democratic-Republicans, this party stood for agrarianism, states’ rights, and strict
                adherence to the Constitution. Over the years, this party has transformed to support
                a stronger federal government, and a looser interpretation of Constitution. Today
                the Democratic Party stands for social justice in the form of larger support for
                social programs which benefit minorities and the poor. They favor social liberalism
                in their support for female reproductive rights, and the legalization of same-sex
                marriage. While this party once held its stronghold in what was known as the “Solid
                South,” since Lyndon Johnson’s signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the
                Voting Rights Act of 1965 the party has been largely replaced in the south by the
                Republican Party. </p>
            <h5>Whig</h5>
            <p>The Whigs first elected a president of their party in 1840 with a victory of William
                Henry Harrison over the Democratic candidate President Martin Van Buren. Following
                Harrison’s death only thirty-one days later and the succession of John Tyler as
                president, the Whigs attempted to implement their policies of a strong central
                government which would promote economic and industrial expansion of the United
                States. The Whigs supported government projects to create an inter-state road and
                canal system along with the implementation of a public school system. In many ways,
                the Whigs can be viewed as the successor party of the Federalists. The Whigs failed
                to adequately address the issue of slavery and thus have not held the White House
                since Millard Fillmore left office in 1853. </p>
            <h5>Republican</h5>
            <p>The second party to have survived into the modern day, the Republican Party, like the
                Democratic Party has needed to change its platform to address the issues of the day
                and thus is almost unrecognizable compared to its original platform. The Republican
                Party was founded largely by Whigs who were disillusioned with their party’s
                inability to come to a firm stance on the issue of slavery. Early members of the
                Republican Party were vehemently opposed to slavery which led to the South’s
                secession when the Republican Party first took control of the White House in 1861
                with the election of Abraham Lincoln. Following the Civil War the Republican Party
                continued to advocate for the rights of African-Americans while also supporting a
                strong Federal Government along with economic and industrial growth. During the
                initial years of the Great Depression, the Republican Party advocated for limited
                intervention in the economy and marginal support for the out of work. Thus, they
                were left out of office for twenty years during the presidencies of Franklin
                Roosevelt and Harry Truman. The party came back into power in 1952 with the election
                of Dwight Eisenhower and today argues for a weaker central government in favor of
                states’ rights, limited intervention in the economy, social conservatism, and a
                strong presence on the world stage. </p></div>
