         <h5>Address by Grover Cleveland</h5>
         <h3>March 4, 1893</h3>
         <p>My Fellow-Citizens:</p>
         <p>In obedience of the mandate of my countrymen I am about to dedicate myself to their
            service under the sanction of a solemn oath. <span class="reference" id="reference1"
               >Deeply moved by the expression of confidence and personal attachment which has
               called me to this service, I am sure my gratitude can make no better return than the
               pledge I now give before <a href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span
                     class="titletooltip" style="display: none;">This is the name of a deity. Click
                     here to learn more about deity names.</span></a> and these witnesses of
               unreserved and complete devotion to the interests and welfare of those who have
               honored me.</span></p>
         <p>I deem it fitting on this occasion, while indicating the opinion I hold concerning
            public questions of present importance, to also briefly refer to the existence of
            certain conditions and tendencies among our people which seem to menace the integrity
            and usefulness of their Government. </p>
         <p>While every American citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and enthusiasm the
            growth and expansion of our country, the sufficiency of our institutions to stand
            against the rudest shocks of violence, the wonderful thrift and enterprise of our
            people, and the demonstrated superiority of our free government, it behooves us to
            constantly watch for every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national
            vigor. </p>
         <p>The strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health courts the sternest activities of
            life and rejoices in the hardihood of constant labor may still have lurking near his
            vitals the unheeded disease that dooms him to sudden collapse. </p>
         <p><span class="reference" id="reference2">It can not be doubted that our stupendous
               achievements as a people and our country’s robust strength have given rise to
               heedlessness of those laws governing our national health which we can no more evade
               than human life can escape the laws of <a href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode"
                     >God<span class="titletooltip" style="display: none;">This is the name of a
                     deity. Click here to learn more about deity names.</span></a> and
               nature.</span></p>
         <p>Manifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the beneficent
            purposes of our Government than a sound and stable currency. Its exposure to degradation
            should at once arouse to activity the most enlightened statesmanship, and the danger of
            depreciation in the purchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the
            strongest incentive to prompt and conservative precaution. </p>
         <p>In dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this subject we will be
            wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our national strength and resources with
            the frank concession that even these will not permit us to defy with impunity the
            inexorable laws of finance and trade. At the same time, in our efforts to adjust
            differences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion, and our judgments
            should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by selfish interests. </p>
         <p>I am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in prudent and effective
            remedial legislation. In the meantime, so far as the executive branch of the Government
            can intervene, none of the powers with which it is invested will be withheld when their
            exercise is deemed necessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial
            disaster. </p>
         <p>Closely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country’s greatness which tends to
            a disregard of the rules of national safety, another danger confronts us not less
            serious. I refer to the prevalence of a popular disposition to expect from the operation
            of the Government especial and direct individual advantages. </p>
         <p>The verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining protection for
            protection’s sake enjoins upon the people’s servants the duty of exposing and destroying
            the brood of kindred evils which are the unwholesome progeny of paternalism. This is the
            bane of republican institutions and the constant peril of our government by the people.
            It degrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers established and
            bequeathed to us as an object of our love and veneration. It perverts the patriotic
            sentiments of our countrymen and tempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain
            to be derived from their Government’s maintenance. It undermines the self-reliance of
            our people and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental favoritism. It
            stifles the spirit of true Americanism and stupefies every ennobling trait of American
            citizenship. </p>
         <p>The lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson taught that while
            the people should patriotically and cheerfully support their Government its functions do
            not include the support of the people. </p>
         <p>The acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and subsidies, which
            burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our citizens to aid ill-advised or
            languishing enterprises in which they have no concern. It leads also to a challenge of
            wild and reckless pension expenditure, which overleaps the bounds of grateful
            recognition of patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the people’s prompt and
            generous impulse to aid those disabled in their country’s defense. </p>
         <p>Every thoughtful American must realize the importance of checking at its beginning any
            tendency in public or private station to regard frugality and economy as virtues which
            we may safely outgrow. The toleration of this idea results in the waste of the people’s
            money by their chosen servants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home
            life of our countrymen. </p>
         <p>Under our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime against the citizen,
            and the contempt of our people for economy and frugality in their personal affairs
            deplorably saps the strength and sturdiness of our national character. </p>
         <p>It is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public expenditures should be
            limited by public necessity, and that this should be measured by the rules of strict
            economy; and it is equally clear that frugality among the people is the best guaranty of
            a contented and strong support of free institutions. </p>
         <p>One mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when appointments to office,
            instead of being the rewards of partisan activity, are awarded to those whose efficiency
            promises a fair return of work for the compensation paid to them. To secure the fitness
            and competency of appointees to office and remove from political action the demoralizing
            madness for spoils, civil-service reform has found a place in our public policy and
            laws. The benefits already gained through this instrumentality and the further
            usefulness it promises entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all who
            desire to see our public service well performed or who hope for the elevation of
            political sentiment and the purification of political methods. </p>
         <p>The existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and combinations of
            business interests formed for the purpose of limiting production and fixing prices is
            inconsistent with the fair field which ought to be open to every independent activity.
            Legitimate strife in business should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the
            demands of combinations that have the power to destroy, nor should the people to be
            served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results from wholesome competition.
            These aggregations and combinations frequently constitute conspiracies against the
            interests of the people, and in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our
            American sense of fairness. To the extent that they can be reached and restrained by
            Federal power the General Government should relieve our citizens from their interference
            and exactions. </p>
         <p>Loyalty to the principles upon which our Government rests positively demands that the
            equality before the law which it guarantees to every citizen should be justly and in
            good faith conceded in all parts of the land. The enjoyment of this right follows the
            badge of citizenship wherever found, and, unimpaired by race or color, it appeals for
            recognition to American manliness and fairness. </p>
         <p>Our relations with the Indians located within our border impose upon us responsibilities
            we can not escape. Humanity and consistency require us to treat them with forbearance
            and in our dealings with them to honestly and considerately regard their rights and
            interests. Every effort should be made to lead them, through the paths of civilization
            and education, to self-supporting and independent citizenship. In the meantime, as the
            nation’s awards, they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of designing men
            and shielded from every influence or temptation that retards their advancement. </p>
         <p>The people of the United States have decreed that on this day the control of their
            Government in its legislative and executive branches shall be given to a political party
            pledged in the most positive terms to the accomplishment of tariff reform. They have
            thus determined in favor of a more just and equitable system of Federal taxation. The
            agents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their promises not less
            than by the command of their masters to devote themselves unremittingly to this service. </p>
         <p>While there should be no surrender of principle, our task must be undertaken wisely and
            without heedless vindictiveness. Our mission is not punishment, but the rectification of
            wrong. If in lifting burdens from the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and
            unequal advantages too long enjoyed, this is but a necessary incident of our return to
            right and justice. If we exact from unwilling minds acquiescence in the theory of an
            honest distribution of the fund of the governmental beneficence treasured up for all, we
            but insist upon a principle which underlies our free institutions. When we tear aside
            the delusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their condition
            under vicious tariff laws, we but show them how far they have been led away from the
            paths of contentment and prosperity. When we proclaim that the necessity for revenue to
            support the Government furnishes the only justification for taxing the people, we
            announce a truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which
            judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the taxing power. And when
            we seek to reinstate the self-confidence and business enterprise of our citizens by
            discrediting an abject dependence upon governmental favor, we strive to stimulate those
            elements of American character which support the hope of American achievement. </p>
         <p>Anxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and solicitude for the
            complete justification of the trust the people have reposed in us constrain me to remind
            those with whom I am to cooperate that we can succeed in doing the work which has been
            especially set before us only by the most sincere, harmonious, and disinterested effort.
            Even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the consummation of our task, we
            shall hardly be excused; and if failure can be traced to our fault or neglect we may be
            sure the people will hold us to a swift and exacting accountability. </p>
         <p>The oath I now take to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United
            States not only impressively defines the great responsibility I assume, but suggests
            obedience to constitutional commands as the rule by which my official conduct must be
            guided. I shall to the best of my ability and within my sphere of duty preserve the
            Constitution by loyally protecting every grant of Federal power it contains, by
            defending all its restraints when attacked by impatience and restlessness, and by
            enforcing its limitations and reservations in favor of the States and the people. </p>
         <p>Fully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and mindful of my
            weakness, I should be appalled if it were my lot to bear unaided the responsibilities
            which await me. I am, however, saved from discouragement when I remember that I shall
            have the support and the counsel and cooperation of wise and patriotic men who will
            stand at my side in Cabinet places or will represent the people in their legislative
            halls. </p>
         <p>I find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and generous and in
            the assurance that they will not condemn those who by sincere devotion to their service
            deserve their forbearance and approval. <span class="reference" id="reference3">Above
