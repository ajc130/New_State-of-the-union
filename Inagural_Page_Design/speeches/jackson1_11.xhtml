         <h5>Address by Andrew Jackson</h5>
         <h3>March 4, 1829</h3>
         <p>Fellow-Citizens:</p>
         <p>About to undertake the arduous duties that I have been appointed to perform by the
            choice of a free people, I avail myself of this customary and solemn occasion to express
            the gratitude which their confidence inspires and to acknowledge the accountability
            which my situation enjoins. While the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no
            thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred, it admonishes me that the best
            return I can make is the zealous dedication of my humble abilities to their service and
            their good. </p>
         <p>As the instrument of the Federal Constitution it will devolve on me for a stated period
            to execute the laws of the United States, to superintend their foreign and their
            confederate relations, to manage their revenue, to command their forces, and, by
            communications to the Legislature, to watch over and to promote their interests
            generally. And the principles of action by which I shall endeavor to accomplish this
            circle of duties it is now proper for me briefly to explain. </p>
         <p>In administering the laws of Congress I shall keep steadily in view the limitations as
            well as the extent of the Executive power, trusting thereby to discharge the functions
            of my office without transcending its authority. With foreign nations it will be my
            study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms, and in
            the adjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance
            becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belonging to a gallant people. </p>
         <p>In such measures as I may be called on to pursue in regard to the rights of the separate
            States I hope to be animated by a proper respect for those sovereign members of our
            Union, taking care not to confound the powers they have reserved to themselves with
            those they have granted to the Confederacy. </p>
         <p>The management of the public revenue—that searching operation in all governments—is
            among the most delicate and important trusts in ours, and it will, of course, demand no
            inconsiderable share of my official solicitude. Under every aspect in which it can be
            considered it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict
            and faithful economy. This I shall aim at the more anxiously both because it will
            facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt, the unnecessary duration of which is
            incompatible with real independence, and because it will counteract that tendency to
            public and private profligacy which a profuse expenditure of money by the Government is
            but too apt to engender. Powerful auxiliaries to the attainment of this desirable end
            are to be found in the regulations provided by the wisdom of Congress for the specific
            appropriation of public money and the prompt accountability of public officers. </p>
         <p>With regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view to revenue, it
            would seem to me that the spirit of equity, caution, and compromise in which the
            Constitution was formed requires that the great interests of agriculture, commerce, and
            manufactures should be equally favored, and that perhaps the only exception to this rule
            should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may
            be found essential to our national independence. </p>
         <p>Internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge, so far as they can be promoted by
            the constitutional acts of the Federal Government, are of high importance. </p>
         <p>Considering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of peace, I shall
            not seek to enlarge our present establishment, nor disregard that salutary lesson of
            political experience which teaches that the military should be held subordinate to the
            civil power. The gradual increase of our Navy, whose flag has displayed in distant
            climes our skill in navigation and our fame in arms; the preservation of our forts,
            arsenals, and dockyards, and the introduction of progressive improvements in the
            discipline and science of both branches of our military service are so plainly
            prescribed by prudence that I should be excused for omitting their mention sooner than
            for enlarging on their importance. But the bulwark of our defense is the national
            militia, which in the present state of our intelligence and population must render us
            invincible. As long as our Government is administered for the good of the people, and is
            regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of person and of
            property, liberty of conscience and of the press, it will be worth defending; and so
            long as it is worth defending a patriotic militia will cover it with an impenetrable
            aegis. Partial injuries and occasional mortifications we may be subjected to, but a
            million of armed freemen, possessed of the means of war, can never be conquered by a
            foreign foe. To any just system, therefore, calculated to strengthen this natural
            safeguard of the country I shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power. </p>
         <p>It will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the Indian tribes within our
            limits a just and liberal policy, and to give that humane and considerate attention to
            their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our Government and
            the feelings of our people. </p>
         <p>The recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of Executive duties,
            in characters too legible to be overlooked, the task of reform, which will require
            particularly the correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage of the
            Federal Government into conflict with the freedom of elections, and the counteraction of
            those causes which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have placed or
            continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands. </p>
         <p>In the performance of a task thus generally delineated I shall endeavor to select men
            whose diligence and talents will insure in their respective stations able and faithful
            cooperation, depending for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity
            and zeal of the public officers than on their numbers. </p>
         <p>A diffidence, perhaps too just, in my own qualifications will teach me to look with
            reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my illustrious predecessors, and with
            veneration to the lights that flow from the mind that founded and the mind that reformed
            our system. The same diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the
            coordinate branches of the Government, and for the indulgence and support of my
            fellow-citizens generally. <span class="reference" id="reference1">And a firm reliance
