         <h5>Address by Abraham Lincoln</h5>
         <h3>March 4, 1865</h3>
         <p>Fellow-Countrymen:</p>
         <p>At this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less
            occasion for an extended address than there was at the first. Then a statement somewhat
            in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of
            four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every
            point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the
            energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms,
            upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it
            is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope for the
            future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured. </p>
         <p>On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously
            directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought to avert it. While the
            inaugural address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the
            Union without war, urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without
            war—seeking to dissolve the Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties
            deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive, and
            the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came. </p>
         <p>One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed generally over
            the Union, but localized in the southern part of it. These slaves constituted a peculiar
            and powerful interest. All knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war. To
            strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents
            would rend the Union even by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than
            to restrict the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected for the war the
            magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the
            cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease.
            Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. <span
