         <h5>Address by Richard M. Nixon</h5>
         <h3>January 20, 1969</h3>
         <p>Senator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President Johnson, Vice
            President Humphrey, my fellow Americans—and my fellow citizens of the world community: </p>
         <p>I ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment. In the orderly transfer of
            power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free. </p>
         <p>Each moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some stand out as
            moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries. This can
            be such a moment. </p>
         <p>Forces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the hope that many of
            man’s deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The spiraling pace of change allows
            us to contemplate, within our own lifetime, advances that once would have taken
            centuries. </p>
         <p>In throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons on earth. For
            the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the leaders of the world
            are afraid of war, the times are on the side of peace. </p>
         <p>Eight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation. Within
            the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will celebrate that great new year which
            comes only once in a thousand years—the beginning of the third millennium. What kind of
            nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in
            the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices. </p>
         <p>The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This honor now beckons
            America—the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil, and onto
            that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization. </p>
         <p>If we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our
            moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind. This is our summons to
            greatness. I believe the American people are ready to answer this call. </p>
         <p>The second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement. We have made
            enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture. We have shared our wealth more
            broadly than ever. We have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its
            continued growth. We have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make its promise
            real for black as well as for white. </p>
         <p>We see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I know America’s youth. I believe in
            them. We can be proud that they are better educated, more committed, more passionately
            driven by conscience than any generation in our history. </p>
         <p>No people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society, or
            so possessed of the will to achieve it. Because our strengths are so great, we can
            afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope. </p>
         <p>Standing in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
            addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear. He could say in surveying
            the Nation’s troubles: <span class="reference" id="reference1">“They concern, thank <a
                  href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span class="titletooltip"
                     style="display: none;">This is the name of a deity. Click here to learn more
                     about deity names.</span></a>, only material things.”</span> Our crisis today
            is the reverse. We have found ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching
            with magnificent precision for the moon, but falling into raucous discord on earth. </p>
         <p>We are caught in war, wanting peace. We are torn by division, wanting unity. We see
            around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks that need doing, waiting for
            hands to do them. To a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit. To find
            that answer, we need only look within ourselves. When we listen to “the better angels of
            our nature,” we find that they celebrate the simple things, the basic things—such as
            goodness, decency, love, kindness. </p>
         <p>Greatness comes in simple trappings.The simple things are the ones most needed today if
            we are to surmount what divides us, and cement what unites us. To lower our voices would
            be a simple thing. </p>
         <p>In these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words; from inflated
            rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from angry rhetoric that fans
            discontents into hatreds; from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading.
            We cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another—until we speak
            quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices. </p>
         <p>For its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new ways—to the voices
            of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without words, the voices of the heart—to the
            injured voices, the anxious voices, the voices that have despaired of being heard. Those
            who have been left out, we will try to bring in. Those left behind, we will help to
            catch up. For all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that makes
            progress possible and our lives secure. </p>
         <p>As we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone before—not turning
            away from the old, but turning toward the new. In this past third of a century,
            government has passed more laws, spent more money, initiated more programs, than in all
            our previous history. </p>
         <p>In pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in education; in
            rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in protecting our environment and
            enhancing the quality of life—in all these and more, we will and must press urgently
            forward. We shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the
            destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home. The American dream
            does not come to those who fall asleep. </p>
         <p>But we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do. Our greatest need now
            is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the
            committed. </p>
         <p>What has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be
            done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing; with
            the people we can do everything. </p>
         <p>To match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our people—enlisted not
            only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in those small, splendid efforts that
            make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal. </p>
         <p>With these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit—each of us raising it one stone
            at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor, helping, caring, doing. </p>
         <p>I do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of grim sacrifice. I
            ask you to join in a high adventure—one as rich as humanity itself, and as exciting as
            the times we live in. The essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of
            his own destiny. </p>
         <p>Until he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly whole. The way to
            fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility in the spirit that
            inspires that use. </p>
         <p>As we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we can produce, but
            as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams. No man can be fully free while
            his neighbor is not. To go forward at all is to go forward together. </p>
         <p>This means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws have caught up
            with our conscience. <span class="reference" id="reference2">What remains is to give
               life to what is in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity
               before <a href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span class="titletooltip"
                     style="display: none;">This is the name of a deity. Click here to learn more
                     about deity names.</span></a>, all are born equal in dignity before man.</span>
            As we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go forward together with
            all mankind. </p>
         <p>Let us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where peace is
            fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it permanent. After a period of
            confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation. Let all nations know that during
            this administration our lines of communication will be open. </p>
         <p>We seek an open world—open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and people—a world in
            which no people, great or small, will live in angry isolation. We cannot expect to make
            everyone our friend, but we can try to make no one our enemy. </p>
         <p>Those who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful competition—not in
            conquering territory or extending dominion, but in enriching the life of man. As we
            explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds together—not as new worlds to
            be conquered, but as a new adventure to be shared. </p>
         <p>With those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms, to
            strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the poor and the hungry. But to all those
            who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we
            need to be for as long as we need to be. </p>
         <p>Over the past twenty years, since I first came to this Capital as a freshman
            Congressman, I have visited most of the nations of the world. I have come to know the
            leaders of the world, and the great forces, the hatreds, the fears that divide the
            world. I know that peace does not come through wishing for it—that there is no
            substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy. </p>
         <p>I also know the people of the world. I have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the
            pain of a man wounded in battle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. I know
            these have no ideology, no race. </p>
         <p>I know America. I know the heart of America is good. I speak from my own heart, and the
            heart of my country, the deep concern we have for those who suffer, and those who
            sorrow. </p>
         <p><span class="reference" id="reference3">I have taken an oath today in the presence of <a
                  href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span class="titletooltip"
                     style="display: none;">This is the name of a deity. Click here to learn more

               Constitution of the United States.</span> To that oath I now add this sacred
            commitment: I shall consecrate my office, my energies, and all the wisdom I can summon,
            to the cause of peace among nations. </p>
         <p>Let this message be heard by strong and weak alike: The peace we seek to win is not
            victory over any other people, but the peace that comes “with healing in its wings”;
            with compassion for those who have suffered; with understanding for those who have
            opposed us; with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own
            destiny. </p>
         <p>
            <span class="reference" id="reference4">Only a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory
               of man’s first sight of the world as <a href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span
                     class="titletooltip" style="display: none;">This is the name of a deity. Click

               reflecting light in the darkness.</span>
            <span class="reference" id="reference5">As the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon’s
               gray surface on Christmas Eve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth—and in that
               voice so clear across the lunar distance, we heard them invoke <a href="god.xhtml#name"
                  class="titlecode">God’s blessing<span class="titletooltip" style="display: none;"
                     >This is the name of a deity. Click here to learn more about deity
                     names.</span></a> on its goodness.</span>
         </p>
         <p>In that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish to write: “To see
            the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it
            floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright
            loveliness in the eternal cold—brothers who know now they are truly brothers.” </p>
         <p>In that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their thoughts toward
            home and humanity—seeing in that far perspective that man’s destiny on earth is not
            divisible; telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in
            the stars but on Earth itself, in our own hands, in our own hearts. </p>
         <p>We have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes catch the dimness
            of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the remaining dark. Let us gather the light. </p>
         <p>Our destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of opportunity. <span
               class="reference" id="reference6">So let us seize it, not in fear, but in
               gladness—and, “riders on the earth together,” let us go forward, firm in our faith,
               steadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our confidence in
               the will of <a href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span class="titletooltip"
