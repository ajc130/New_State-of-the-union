         <h5>Address by Franklin D. Roosevelt</h5>
         <h3>January 20, 1945</h3>
         <p>Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, my friends, you will understand and, I believe,
            agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words brief. </p>
         <p>We Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a period of supreme
            test. It is a test of our courage—of our resolve—of our wisdom—our essential democracy. </p>
         <p>If we meet that test—successfully and honorably—we shall perform a service of historic
            importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time. </p>
         <p><span class="reference" id="reference1">As I stand here today, having taken the solemn
               oath of office in the presence of my fellow countrymen—in the presence of our <a
                  href="god.xhtml#name" class="titlecode">God<span class="titletooltip"
                     style="display: none;">This is the name of a deity. Click here to learn more
                     about deity names.</span></a></span>—I know that it is America’s purpose that
            we shall not fail. </p>
         <p>In the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just and honorable
            peace, a durable peace, as today we work and fight for total victory in war. </p>
         <p>We can and we will achieve such a peace.</p>
         <p>We shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it immediately—but we still shall
            strive. We may make mistakes—but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness
            of heart or abandonment of moral principle. </p>
         <p>I remember that my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said, in days that seemed to us then
            to be secure and untroubled: “Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we
            will be rising toward the heights—then all will seem to reverse itself and start
            downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever
            upward; that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the
            centuries always has an upward trend.” </p>
         <p>Our Constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument; it is not perfect yet. But it
            provided a firm base upon which all manner of men, of all races and colors and creeds,
            could build our solid structure of democracy. </p>
         <p>And so today, in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons—at a fearful cost—and
            we shall profit by them. </p>
         <p>We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is
            dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We have learned that we must live
            as men, not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the manger. </p>
         <p>We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.</p>
         <p>We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that “The only way to have a friend
            is to be one.” </p>
         <p>We can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear.
            We can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding, the confidence, and the
            courage which flow from conviction. </p>
