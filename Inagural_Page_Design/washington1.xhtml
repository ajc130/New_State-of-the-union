         <h5>Address by George Washington</h5>
         <h3>April 30, 1793</h3>
         
         <p>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: </p>
         
         <p>Among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater
            anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order, and
            received on the 14th day of the present month. On the one hand, I was summoned by
            my
            country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat
            which
            I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an
            immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years—a retreat which was rendered
            every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to
            inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed
            on it by time. On the other hand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which
            the
            voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most
            experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could
            not
            but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature
            and
            unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious
            of
            his own deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that it has
            been
            my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance
            by
            which it might be affected. All I dare hope is that if, in executing this task, I
            have
            been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an
            affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my
            fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as
            disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated
            by the motives which mislead me, and its consequences be judged by my country with
            some
            share of the partiality in which they originated.
         </p>
         
         
         
         <p><span class="reference">Such being the impressions under which
               I have, in obedience to the public summons, repaired to the present station, it
               would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent
               supplications to that <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected the title of a deity. Click to learn more about titles of dieties','title.xhtml')">Almighty Being</span> who rules over the
               universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can
               supply every human defect,</span>
            <span class="reference">that <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected a pronoun connected to a diety. Click to learn more about pronouns connected to dieties','pronoun.xhtml')">His</span>
               benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the
               United States a Government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes,
               and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with
               success the functions allotted to his charge.</span>
            <span class="reference">In tendering this homage to the <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected the title of a deity. Click to learn more about titles of dieties','title.xhtml')">Great Author of every public and private good</span>, I assure
               myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own, nor those of my
               fellow-citizens at large less than either.</span>
            <span class="reference">No people can be bound to acknowledge and
               adore the <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected a poetic illusion to a deity. Click to learn more about poetic illusions to dieties','poetic.xhtml')">Invisible Hand</span> which conducts the affairs of men
               more than those of the United States.</span>
            <span class="reference">Every step by which they have advanced to
               the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some
               token of <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected a poetic illusion to a deity. Click to learn more about poetic illusions to dieties','poetic.xhtml')">providential agency</span>; and in the important
               revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil
               deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the
               event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have
               been established without some return of pious gratitude, along with an humble
               anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage.</span>
            These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves too
            strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me, I trust, in thinking
            that
            there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government
            can more auspiciously commence. 
         </p>
         
         <p>By the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the President
            “to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and
            expedient.” The circumstances under which I now meet you will acquit me from entering
            into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under
            which
            you are assembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which
            your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances,
            and
            far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of
            a
            recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the
            rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt
            them. In these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on one
            side
            no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party animosities, will
            misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great
            assemblage of communities and interests, so, on another, that the foundation of our
            national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality,
            and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which
            can
            win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. <span class="reference">I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction
               which an ardent love for my country can inspire, since there is no truth more
               thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature
               an
               indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage; between
               the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of
               public prosperity and felicity; since we ought to be no less persuaded that the
               propitious smiles of <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected a poetic illusion to a deity. Click to learn more about poetic illusions to dieties','poetic.xhtml')">Heaven</span> can never be expected on a
               nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected a poetic illusion to a deity. Click to learn more about poetic illusions to dieties','poetic.xhtml')">Heaven</span> itself has ordained; and since the preservation of
               the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are
               justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked on the experiment
               entrusted to the hands of the American people.</span>
            
         </p>
         
         <p>Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your judgment
            to
            decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article
            of the
            Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections
            which have been urged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has
            given
            birth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject,
            in
            which I could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities, I shall
            again
            give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good;
            for
            I assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger
            the benefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await the future
            lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a
            regard
            for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question
            how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and
            advantageously promoted. 
         </p>
         
         <p>To the foregoing observations I have one to add, which will be most properly addressed
            to
            the House of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore be as brief as
            possible. When I was first honored with a call into the service of my country, then
            on
            the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated
            my
            duty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From this resolution
            I have in no instance departed; and being still under the impressions which produced
            it,
            I must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which
            may
            be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department, and
            must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I am placed
            may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public
            good may be thought to require. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
            <span class="reference">Having thus imparted to you my
               sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together, I
               shall take my present leave; but not without resorting once more to the benign <span style="color:#a70a0a ;" onclick="overlay('id1','You have selected a poetic illusion to a deity.
