         <p>Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, my friends, you will understand and, I
                believe, agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its
                words brief.</p>
         <p>We Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a period of
                supreme test. It is a test of our courage—of our resolve—of our wisdom—our essential
                democracy.</p>
         <p>If we meet that test—successfully and honorably—we shall perform a service of
                historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time.</p>
         <p>As I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of my
                fellow countrymen—<reference category="praise" type="direct">in the presence of<god style="name">our God</god></reference>—I know that it is America’s purpose
                that we shall not fail.</p>
         <p>In the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just and honorable
                peace, a durable peace, as today we work and fight for total victory in war.</p>
         <p>We can and we will achieve such a peace.</p>
         <p>We shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it immediately—but we still
                shall strive. We may make mistakes—but they must never be mistakes which result from
                faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle.</p>
         <p>I remember that my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said, in days that seemed to us
                then to be secure and untroubled: “Things in life will not always run smoothly.
                Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights—then all will seem to reverse itself
                and start downward. The great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization
                itself is forever upward; that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the
                valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.”</p>
         <p>Our Constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument; it is not perfect yet. But it
                provided a firm base upon which all manner of men, of all races and colors and
                creeds, could build our solid structure of democracy.</p>
         <p>And so today, in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons—at a fearful
                cost—and we shall profit by them.</p>
         <p>We have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own well-being is
                dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We have learned that we must
                live as men, not as ostriches, nor as dogs in the manger.</p>
         <p>We have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human community.</p>
         <p>We have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that “The only way to have a
                friend is to be one.”</p>
         <p>We can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with
                fear. We can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding, the confidence, and
                the courage which flow from conviction.</p>
         <p><reference type="direct" category="praise"><god style="name">The Almighty God</god>has blessed our land in many ways.<god style="pronoun">He</god>has given our people stout
                hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth.<god style="pronoun">He</god>
                has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an
                anguished world.</reference></p>
         <p><reference category="supplication" type="direct">So we pray to<god style="pronoun">Him</god>now for the vision to see our way clearly—to see the way that
                leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men—to the achievement
                of<god style="pronoun">His</god>will to peace on earth.</reference></p>
