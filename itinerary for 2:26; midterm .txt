Generally, xml is looking good as far as I can tell. It is great that you have started an xslt; we can work on problems with it tomorrow (listed a few below in this long ass rambling text block while I looked at the repo/site)

Midterm plans: I see it as one or the other of either making some significant data mining effort (which would require getting a big headstart on XQuery, which would not be the worst thing), or doing MAJOR site structural building (would have to be pretty significant to constitute a midterm), and would allow you to have one (huge) thing less to worry about when you get around to data mining/interpreting/building graphs and sick shit like that. 

	-still haven't learned XQuery, so data mining possibly not best idea for midterm goal; on the other hand, end of the semester is rapidly approaching (another month and a half or so?) and you really want to get some working data as soon as possible so that you can move on to thinking about interpretation and presentation of said data, supplementary technology (Gephi social networking graph a possible idea, topic modeling, etc.)
	-that in mind: xslt/ site construction? 
		-problems with site now: obvious big menu problems right now; take a look at that. Very much need to set as a SSI, which will make the work of fixing/editing it a lot simpler as well. need to finalize what will actually be in the menu as well.  need to adjust XSLT and/or speech CSS/(js?) to interact with references in a useful way (outputting spans now, but looks like there is a slight error in skipping spaces? Go to last paragraph of polk speech). Also need to fix title element; should not output tech jargon. CSS is issue of taste; personally I would add more right padding to the paragraphs and put the bio box to the right (stagnant or sliding with scroll optional). Need to snazz up general CSS; get some color on that shit. Big fan of that regal scarlet. More general site structure, need to create the pages where demographic and reference data will be accessible--both from speeches and leading to speeches. Quote at top of speech pages should be, well, in quotes probably (also find out what route chose to do that). Each speech page should probably include link to that speech's xml file as well, which will all have to be up on the site directory in their own folder (we'll talk about that--can use neat xsl stuff to easily do it, cause xsl is incredibly).

I need to see that xslt also. I love xsl.
